## This is a tool for generating RPG-like items for a custom DnD called GOW (Game of Wycc)
Built with JavaFX and Java 8<br>
It generates item stats randomly depending on the desired price. 
The price is calculated accordingly to the configuration set in the application.<br>
Examples:<br>

TODO list:

  - make stats-to-price configuration persistent
